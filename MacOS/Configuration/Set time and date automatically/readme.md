Configures the device to sync its clock wtih a NTP server

If you have a similar error: 
systemsetup[5499:27414] ### Error:-99 File:/AppleInternal/Library/BuildRoots/2a53ee2d-6754-11ed-a659-7ef33c48bc85/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/Admin/InternetServices.m Line:379


Please proceed with the following steps: 


1) Created a root user with a password like this page: How to enable the root user or change the root password on Mac - Apple Support.


2) Then logged in as root and changed the timezone like this page: https://macosx-faq.com/how-to-change-date-time-terminal/


3) Then logged in my own account and checked the timezone which was the right way set.


4) Then disabled the root user as the first page explained.


Good luck!
