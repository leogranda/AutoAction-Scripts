#  SYNOPSIS
#    Installs Microsoft Office 365 on the target device
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#    This script checks to see if Office 365 is installed
#    on the target device and if it isn't, downloads it from
#    Microsoft's servers and installs it.
#
#    Note: this script is optional and to be used in the case where
#    you need the app to be reinstalled if it's uninstalled. Also,
#    the installer is over 8GB so it takes a while for the script to run.
#
#
#  USAGE
#    ./install_O365.sh
